There is a party with 8 guests in my house. I've hired a waiter from a catering company to serve you. We have "b√∂rek", "cake" and "drink" to be consumed by my 10 guests (30 boreks, 15 slices of cake and 30 glasses of drink). There are 3 trays, each has a capacity of 5 (5 boreks on borek tray, 5 slices of cake on cake tray and 5 glasses of drink on drink tray). As the guests eat and drink, a waiter will fill the trays (when there is 0 or 1 left on the tray). Every guest must eat and drink from all types of food and drink at least once. A guest can eat max 4 boreks and drink 4 glasses of drink, but can eat only 2 slices of cake. This will last until all food and drink is consumed
